The author explains that Dial&rsquo;s &ldquo;aha moment&rdquo; came when he determined the Chukars used &ldquo;their wings and legs cooperatively&rdquo; to scale the hay bales (lines 40-42). Dial then created additional experiments to study how the birds dealt with gradually steeper inclines: &ldquo;[he filmed] the birds as they raced up textured ramps tilted at increasing angles&rdquo; (lines 46-48).<p>Choices A, B, and D are incorrect because Dial&rsquo;s &ldquo;aha moment&rdquo; was not followed by Dial teaching the birds to fly, studying videos to find out why the birds no longer hopped, or consulting with other researchers.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></p>\n",
